referenced w3Schools for a lot of the CSS refreshers

used w3Schools also for the search feature. That was difficult to implement as I was wanting a broad search to happen across multiple fields of the entries but could only get the name of the entry to work.

An unsolved issue was the search parameters. Also, had a lot of initial frustration with getting it deployed to heroku but Tim, Casey and Sean were able to help as it was involving a typo and reorganization.
